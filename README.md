# Description
This project is a take on the knapsack problem. It uses N number of objects and runs them through two different algorithms, CreateBruteForceTree() and RandomTree(). The goal here is to return a binary tree with the highest weight to price ratio. 

# Examples
If you are wanting to set N go to line 343 in the code and change it, otherwise it will default to 50 objects used.

# Reason For this Project
We chose this project because its a very unique problem that doesn't have an exact solution. It is very interesting to see what different people and ourselves have come up with to try to solve the knapsack problem in the most efficient way.

# Data Structures Used
1. Sort - We used sort to make parsing the data into the binary tree more efficient since they would already be in greatest to least ratio order
2. Binary Tree - We chose binary trees to store the data in a a easy to read and understand pattern. 

# Algorithms Used
1. Brute Force - Brute force was used since it will come up with the best possible scenario, however, it is also the slowest algorithm possible and won't be useful in every setting.
2. Random - Random was used for its quick ability to choose data points and throw them into the "knapsack" as fast as possible.
